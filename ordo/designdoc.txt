    PICK ?



change from automagick Pop to one
that needs to be called by the user ?
    then we'd have Strargs and Numargs
    and at least one stack more for
    the stuff immediatelly in use.
        Make that stack a general one ?



search character classes:
    whitespaces
    num
    alpha
    alphanum
    brackets


Add for repeatCmd an inline `macro` def:
    ie.
        (^ 4 `(` ` i)` rep → indent-right)

some kind of enhanced syntax for rep
`(` ` i)` doesn't really work

(^ 4 {` ` i} rep → indent-right)

Need a test for current char


Either change quoting so that nested
patterns are simple to handle or do
a little more parsing and stack foolery.
