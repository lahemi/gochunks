Ð etc, basic operators take two or one args, either
Ð by popping them from global stack, specifically
Ð popped from a named stack, or "cloning"
Ð from a referenced named stack.

1 2 3 :x    Ð fstack to x label in env

'x          Ð ref

2 2 :y

'y +        Ð 2 + 2 to global stack

'x /+       Ð 1 + 2 + 3 global stack

'x /+ :z    Ð 1+2+3 to z

Ð operator alone either pops one or two
Ð floats from the stack, does its operation
Ð and pushes the result to given stack
Ð default being the global stack
Ð newline or ; terminates a stack|expression

Ð ı takes one arg, and which is used as the limit
Ð returning a stack from 1 to the limit

6 ı/×   Ð factorial of 6

Ð / reduce
Ð º apply
Ð (operator) applies the operators func to preceeding
Ð stack, taking the right most elem as an argument
Ð if the operator needs two

'x 5 º+ :x    Ð 1+5 2+5 3+5, x rebound to them
'x 5 (+) :x

Ð concat stacks
'y 'x 'z :q     Ð 2 2 6 7 8 6 to q

!x      Ð pop one elem from x
2 @ x   Ð push 2 to x
