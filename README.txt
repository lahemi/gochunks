A simple WIP play shell.


corecmds

Golang implementations of some of the basic *nix utilities.
Written in a simpler Plan9-like manner compared to what
you might be used to.


IRCs

    - botting
    Straightforward and simple IRC bot, with some example
    functionality implemented. See its README.

    - clienting
    A rough base for an IRC client.



These work at least with both Go1.1 and Go1.2.
They are also currently unencumbered by licensing.
