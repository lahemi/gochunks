plush

    - A simple WIP play shell.


corecmds

    - Simplified implementations of some of the basic *nix utilities.


IRCs

    - botting
    Straightforward and simple IRC bot, with some example
    functionality implemented. See its README.

    - clienting
    A rough base for an IRC client.

    - parabot
    Much nicer IRC bot than the one in `botting`.
    Uses goroutines, and is better thought out, too.


wavsy

    - Wavsy itself is a meager little wav creation librar-ish.

    - Wavexample is a small example using wavsy.

    - Frequencisize is gives you frequencies of musical notes.

    - Firstnotes uses both wavsy and frequencisize, in a little example.


brainfuck

    - Yes.


These work at least with Go1.1-1.3.
They are also currently unencumbered by licensing.
