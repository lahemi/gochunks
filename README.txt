plush

    - A simple WIP play shell.


corecmds

    - Simplified implementations of some of the basic *nix utilities.


IRCs

    - botting
    Straightforward and simple IRC bot, with some example
    functionality implemented. See its README.

    - clienting
    A rough base for an IRC client.


wavsy

    - Wavsy itself is a meager little wav creation librar-ish.

    - Wavexample is a small example using wavsy.

    - Frequencisize is gives you frequencies of musical notes.

    - Firstnotes uses both wavsy and frequencisize, in a little example.


brainfuck

    - Yes.


callang

    - WIP ad hoc ex tempore esolang I use with naib, my most recent IRC bot.


FORTHIE

    - A sort strongly typed mini-FORTH.
    - Compiling words and branching works, the latter sort of.
    - No looping implemented yet, the primitives are there though.
    - Current data types are integer, float64, and string.
    - Thanks to Go, FORTH code is handled as UTF-8, non-ASCII is not a problem.
    - Quite a bit of "builtin" words.


ordo

    A character(rune) oriented text "editing" language.
    Something a between ed and TECO, much in the works at the moment though.


bitap

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitap_algorithm at least sort of
    implemented in Go, as a way in trying to understand the algorithm.


These work at least with Go1.1-1.3.
They are also currently unencumbered by licensing.
