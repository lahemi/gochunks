A straightforward small IRC bot. Seems to differ a bit from
the implementation of quite many other IRCbots written in Go.

You need to place fortunes.txt in $HOME/.local/share/gestelle/
and conf.json in $HOME/.config/gestelle/

There is non-sane placeholders in conf.json, do modify that before
running the bot.

The bot is still somewhat incomplete and the code has not been
refactored properly, though it should be clear enough to see
how things are done.
